   The other two files (annotations.ini and bitmap image) are created on demand. The bitmap image is created by picking the original bitmap image and creating a black zone 
   for each implanted physical object. 
   In the UI, a set screen was developed (setupRegions) but we didn't complete this feature.
  -jdk version is now 17

  -DataPopulatorSpringImpl.createCheckDataFolders: we are now checking read/write access to all data descendant folders

Release: 4.10.1
  -Created distribution for BetterFactory, to be available on the RAMP GitHub repo
  -Updated the documentation available on the deploy folder
  -Corrected bad behaviour of the front end: updated of the production schedule were being requested to the back end even though 
    there was no instance of the production schedule 
  -Deleted the distributions rennes2 and rennes3

Release: 4.10.0
  -Updated sbt from 1.6.1 to 1.6.2

  -Created new property apm.TopicsLoggerService.disable.trace.in-heart-beep
  -Updated spring-data-mongodb from 3.2.8 to 3.3.1, had to change the initial-data files on some definitions, to make sure that the "id" fields mentioned on each
   hierarchical object are unique. Somehow, until spring-data-mongodb 3.2.8 version this was not causing any problem. Didn't change initial-data for rennes2 and rennes3.

Release: 4.9.0
  -Changed the server so that only one instance of the APM is used on the RAMP docker-based environment. 
    A single instance of the server is used to support several entities. 
    User must use urls on the form https://..../xxx where xxx is the identity of the entity the User is related to.
    The reverse-proxy extracts this identifier from the URL and inserts in a HTTP header.
    The server uses this to set the apropriate context for the entity. Diferent entities have different databases and 'data' folders.

Release: 4.8.2
  -Changed the frontend in order to be able to have several APM instances in a docker distribution accessible on the same port by using an URL prefix in all the interactions with the back-end server.

      -root has two children -reference robot and implantation

   The World Model generated in the scope of a Mission only has the correspondent robot:
